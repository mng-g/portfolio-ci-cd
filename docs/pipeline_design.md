# CI/CD Pipeline Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design of the CI/CD pipeline for this project. It covers key pipeline steps, quality metrics, and advanced features.

## Key Pipeline Steps
1. **Code Checkout:** Pull the latest code from the repository.
2. **Linting:** Static code analysis using tools like flake8 or pylint.
3. **Testing:** Unit and integration tests with a target code coverage of 80%+.
4. **Build:** Docker image creation.
5. **Packaging:** Artifact tagging and versioning.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy to staging and then to production with health checks.

## Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage:** Minimum 80% coverage.
- **Static Analysis:** No critical warnings/errors.
- **Security:** Vulnerability scans on dependencies and container images.
- **Deployment Success Rate:** Monitored via health checks.

## Advanced Features
- **Matrix Builds:** Run tests across multiple Python versions.
- **Caching:** Cache dependencies to speed up builds.
- **Parallelism:** Execute independent jobs concurrently.
- **Advanced Deployment:** Blue-green deployments and canary releases.
