# Portfolio CI/CD

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a Python web application with a DevOps theme. The goal is to showcase best practices in continuous integration and continuous delivery using GitHub Actions and Docker.

## Overview

- **Application:** A simple Python web app themed around DevOps.
- **CI/CD Tools:** GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Containerization:** Docker is used to package the application for consistency across environments.
- **Notifications:** Future integrations (e.g., Slack or email) can be added to alert on pipeline events.

```

## Branching Strategy

- **main:** Contains production-ready code.
- **develop:** Integration branch where features are merged and tested.
- **feature/\*** and **bugfix/\***: For individual features and bug fixes, respectively.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline (detailed in `docs/pipeline_diagram.md`) will:

1. Run automated tests on every push.
2. Build a Docker image upon successful tests.
3. Deploy the container to a staging or production environment.
4. Send notifications on build and deploy events.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-ci-cd.git
   ```
2. **Create and switch to a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Next Steps

- **Branch Protection:** Branch rules (including pull request requirements) are configured to enforce best practices.
- **Pipeline Setup:** GitHub Actions workflows are set up for CI and CD.
- **Documentation:** Further documentation is available in the `docs/` folder.
